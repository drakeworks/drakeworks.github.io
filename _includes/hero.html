            <p class="hero__subtitle">Certified product (CSPOÂ®) and project (PMPÂ®) leader, former digital nomad, amateur coder, and digital privacy advocate</p>
            

            
            <div class="hero__description"><p>I lead software product teams by blending business strategy with technical fluency. Iâ€™ve managed teams, launched products, and even my own company, but I still love getting into the technical weeds. New Orleans is home, but Iâ€™ve spent the last decade working remotely as a digital nomad, helping build some of the most exciting fintech, blockchain, and video game products on the market.</p>

                                          <p>This blog is part showcase, part knowledge base, and hopefully a useful resource for anyone navigating the intersection of product, code, and curiosity (with the occasional cajun recipe, just to keep things spicy).</p>
