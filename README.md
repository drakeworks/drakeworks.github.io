## Deployment

This project uses a staging-to-production deployment workflow:

### Staging Repository
- **Purpose**: Development and testing environment
- **Branch**: `main`

### Production Repository  
- **Purpose**: Live site deployment
- **Branch**: `main`

### Manual Deployment

To deploy from staging to production:

1. **Set up GitHub Token** (one-time setup):
   - Go to GitHub Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens
   - Create a new token with `repo` permissions
   - Add the token as a repository secret named `PRODUCTION_TOKEN` in the staging repository

2. **Trigger Deployment**:
   - Go to the staging repository on GitHub
   - Navigate to Actions â†’ "Deploy to Production"
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Set "Deploy to production?" to `true`
   - Click "Run workflow"

The workflow will:
- Checkout the staging repository
- Copy files to the production repository
- Trigger the build workflow in the production repository
- Deploy the site to GitHub Pages

### Workflow Setup

**Both Repositories** have the same workflow file (`.github/workflows/jekyll.yml`):

**Staging Repository**:
- âœ… Has deployment workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-to-production.yml`)
- âœ… Has build workflow (builds but doesn't deploy)
- ðŸ”„ Manual deployment trigger
- ðŸ”„ Automatic build on push (continues if error)

**Production Repository**:
- âœ… Has build and deploy workflow (same file as staging)
- âœ… Automatically builds and deploys when content is pushed
- âœ… Deploys to GitHub Pages
- ðŸ”„ Triggered by staging deployment or direct pushes
