/**
 * Main SCSS Entry Point
 * ====================
 * 
 * This is the primary SCSS file that imports all partials and generates
 * the final CSS output. Jekyll processes this file and compiles it into
 * the main.css file served to the browser.
 * 
 * Structure:
 * - Uses modern @use syntax for better performance and namespacing
 * - Imports are ordered from most fundamental to most specific
 * - All partials are located in the ../scss/ directory
 * 
 * Import Order:
 * 1. variables - CSS custom properties and theme variables
 * 2. base - Global resets, typography, and basic elements
 * 3. layout - Page structure and layout components
 * 4. grid - Responsive grid system and breakpoints
 * 5. components - Reusable UI components and widgets
 * 6. pages - Page-specific styles and layouts
 * 7. utilities - Helper classes and utility functions
