If you'd told college-me that my first "real" job would be playing video games for money, I would've assumed you were lying or trying to rope me into some pyramid scheme involving Doritos & Red Bull. But it was real. And it changed my life.  

## The Dream Job: QA at Electronic Arts  

My first day in QA at Electronic Arts was exactly what you think: endless rows of consoles, the faint smell of overheated dev kits, and testers who could recall obscure crash bugs with the same precision most people reserve for birthdays.  

It was, without exaggeration, a dream job. I got paid to break games—pressing every button at once, running headfirst into walls, yanking out controllers mid-cutscene... pure chaos (shout out to my fellow compliance testers!), but with a paycheck.  

More importantly, it taught me discipline, collaboration, and how to write a bug report so clear a programmer on another continent could reproduce it without swearing at me in the process.  

That QA foundation eventually led me into HR and Operations, roles I never expected to love. I learned how massive creative teams actually function, how to build processes, resolve conflicts, and support people while they built the games of their dreams—and sometimes their nightmares.

## A Labor of Love, with a Reality Check  

Here's the thing: the games industry runs on passion. That passion carries you through late nights, impossible deadlines, and vending machines stocked only with Mountain Dew Code Red.  

But passion doesn't pay rent forever. When I relocated to Taiwan, I started asking a harder question: was staying in games actually sustainable long-term?  

## Why I Stepped Away  

It wasn't an easy decision, but a few truths got louder with time:  

- Layoffs are the norm, not the exception. Even the big, shiny studios cut hundreds or thousands of jobs overnight.  
- Salaries lag behind. You'll get paid more to build accounting software than to make sure your RPG doesn't implode when a chicken walks across a bridge.  
- Work-life balance is, let's be polite, aspirational.  

I wanted stability, growth, and the ability to support a family. So I had to walk away...  

## The Latest Wave of Layoffs  

If you've followed the news, you know it's been rough. Microsoft just announced sweeping cuts across multiple studios. They're not alone. Since 2023, we've seen layoffs at:  

- Bungie  
- Epic Games  
- Unity Technologies  
- Riot Games  
- Take-Two Interactive  
- …and plenty more  

The list is long, and it proves the volatility isn't going anywhere.  

## This Isn't New: A Timeline Since 2010  

Quick tour of the last 15 years:  

- **2010–2014:** Mobile free-to-play takes off, followed by countless studio implosions.  
- **2015–2019:** Consolidation. Mid-sized developers swallowed up or shut down.  
- **2020–2022:** Pandemic boom. Record revenues, massive hiring.  
- **2023–2025:** Reality check. Overexpansion meets economic slowdown.  

If it feels like déjà vu, you're not wrong.  

## Why Moving to Adjacent Industries Made Sense  

Leaving games wasn't abandoning passion. It was about applying those hard-earned skills somewhere more sustainable.  

Turns out, the things you learn in gaming—QA rigor, cross-team collaboration, empathy for the end user—translate beautifully to other industries:  

- **Enterprise Software** (also needs to not crash)  
- **EdTech** (gamification is big here)  
- **AR/VR & Simulation** (all the cool tech, slightly less crunch)  

If you're considering the same shift, know this: your skills are worth more than you think.  

## Advice for Aspiring Game Industry Pros  

If you're just starting out, here's my two cents:  

- Hedge your bets. Build a portfolio that works across industries.  
- Do your homework. Look for studios with financial transparency and sustainable practices.  
- Follow your dream, but keep your eyes open.  

It's completely fine to love games and still want a stable life.  

## In the End  

I wouldn't trade my time in games for anything. It gave me resilience, lifelong friendships, and more stories than I'll ever need.  

But I also love having a predictable paycheck and the freedom to play games just for fun again.  

If you're considering a career in video games, do it. But go in prepared. Passion will get you started, perspective will keep you afloat.  

And for the love of all things digital—save your work.
