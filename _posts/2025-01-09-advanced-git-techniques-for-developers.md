# Advanced Git Techniques for Developers

Git is more than just `commit` and `push`. Here are some advanced techniques:

## Useful Commands

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3   # Interactive rebase last 3 commits
git stash pop          # Reapply stashed changes
git bisect start       # Find the commit that introduced a bug
```

## Pro Tips

- Use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for CI/CD
- Write clear commit messages
- Branch often, merge carefully
