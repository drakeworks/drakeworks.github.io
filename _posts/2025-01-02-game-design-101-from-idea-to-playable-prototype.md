# Game Design 101: From Idea to Playable Prototype

Ever wanted to make your own game? Here's how to start:

## Steps to Success

1. **Brainstorm**: Write down every idea, no matter how wild.
2. **Prototype**: Build a simple version using free tools like [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).
3. **Playtest**: Get feedback early and often.

> "The best games are easy to learn and hard to master." â€” Nolan Bushnell

### Example: Simple Game Loop (Pseudo-code)

```python
while not game_over:
    process_input()
    update_game_state()
    render()
```
