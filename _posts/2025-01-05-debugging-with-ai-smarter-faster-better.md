AI-powered tools are changing the way developers find and fix bugs. Here's how you can leverage AI for smarter, faster debugging.

## AI Debugging Features
- **Automated Error Detection**: Instantly spot issues in your code
- **Code Suggestions**: Get real-time fixes and improvements
- **Learning from Data**: AI learns from millions of codebases
- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions about your code and get instant answers

> "To err is human, to debug is divine."

## How to Integrate AI into Your Workflow
1. Use tools like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) for code suggestions
2. Set up continuous integration with AI-powered static analysis
3. Review AI-generated fixes, but always test thoroughly

### Example: AI-Assisted Debugging Session
```python
# Example: Using an AI assistant to fix a bug
# Original buggy code
result = divide(10, 0)
# AI suggests:
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b if b != 0 else None
result = divide(10, 0)
```
