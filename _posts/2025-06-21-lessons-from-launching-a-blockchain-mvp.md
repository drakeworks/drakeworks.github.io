Building a minimum viable product (MVP) for a blockchain solution comes with unique challenges and opportunities. Here's what you need to know to succeed.

## Top Takeaways
- **Start Simple**: Focus on a single use case and validate it quickly.
- **Test Early**: Use testnets and gather feedback from real users.
- **Iterate Fast**: Blockchain moves quickly—so should you. Don't wait for perfection.
- **Security First**: Smart contracts are immutable—test thoroughly and consider audits.

> "Your MVP is not your final product. It's a learning tool."

## Common Pitfalls
- Overcomplicating smart contracts
- Ignoring user onboarding and education
- Underestimating security and compliance needs
- Failing to plan for scalability

### Example: MVP Launch Timeline
| Phase      | Key Actions                  |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| Ideation   | Define core value, sketch UI |
| Build      | Develop smart contract MVP   |
| Test       | Deploy to testnet, get feedback |
| Launch     | Mainnet release, monitor     |
