# Smart Contracts Explained: The Backbone of Decentralized Apps

Smart contracts are self-executing agreements with the terms directly written into code.

## How They Work

- **Trustless**: No need for intermediaries
- **Transparent**: Code is visible to all participants
- **Automatic**: Executes when conditions are met

### Example: Simple Smart Contract (Solidity)

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint storedData;
    function set(uint x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }
    function get() public view returns (uint) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```
