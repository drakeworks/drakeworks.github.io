Developers face unique time challenges. Here's how to stay on track and maximize your productivity.

## Top Tips

- **Use the Pomodoro Technique**: 25 minutes of focus, 5 minutes of break
- **Automate repetitive tasks**: Use scripts and tools to save time
- **Prioritize with the Eisenhower Matrix**: Focus on what's important, not just urgent
- **Batch similar tasks**: Group code reviews, meetings, and emails

> "Focus on being productive instead of busy." â€” Tim Ferriss

### Sample Schedule

|-------|---------------------|
| 9:00  | Code review         |
| 10:00 | Feature development |
| 12:00 | Lunch break         |
| 13:00 | Team meeting        |
| 14:00 | Debugging           |
