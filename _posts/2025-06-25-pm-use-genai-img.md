Generative AI isn't magic. It's messy, occasionally hilarious when it's wrong, and still really good at saving you from drowning in grunt work. The best PMs aren't chasing hype. They're plugging genAI into their workflows where it removes friction and helps them make better calls faster. I've been on both ends of this. AI that saved my bacon and AI that nearly embarrassed me in front of a room full of execs. Here's the honest take: what works, what doesn't, and what's worth doing Monday morning.

## Why AI in Product Management Now  

Let's cut through the noise. AI didn't replace jobs, but it did hit the point where PMs can actually use it without babysitting models all day. Costs are real now. Tokens and latency show up as line items in budgets. And compliance? Regulators are wide awake. If you're not thinking about GDPR updates or AI-specific audits, your Legal team is, and they'll slow you down harder than any engineering dependency ever could.

## Where I Actually Use GenAI  

Here's my filter: if I'd happily dump a task on a never-sleeping intern, AI is probably a good fit.  

- **Market and competitor scans:** No more doomscrolling Twitter and PDF skimming. AI gives me a decent first pass.  
- **PRD and spec writing:** Boilerplate? Done. Strategy sections still need me, but at least the doc has bones.  
- **User research synthesis:** Clustering and tagging feedback without drowning in sticky notes. I still verify, but the lift is lighter.

- **Roadmap prioritization:** It doesn't set strategy, but it does surface patterns that help me win debates.  
- **Visual artifacts:** I've even used genAI to draft wireframes in HTML and map out complex flows with UML diagrams. Are they perfect? No. But they're good enough to get a conversation started with design or engineering, which is all you really need at the earliest stage.

### Story: The 24-Hour PRD Fire Drill  

Here's one that still makes me laugh. A while back, someone on our team sent a meeting prep email to the wrong address. Instead of landing quietly in a folder, it went straight to an exec who promptly asked for a draft PRD on a peer-to-peer crypto marketplace. The kicker? The quarterly meeting was in 24 hours.  

Normally, that kind of request would take me a week at minimum. Competitive scans, data pulls, structuring the document, and writing everything cleanly. Without a draft, I would have walked into that room empty handed and red faced.  

Instead, I pulled every rough note and competitor screenshot I had, jammed it into a genAI tool, and got a usable draft in minutes. Not perfect, but enough of a skeleton that I could spend the night polishing, fact checking, and tightening it up. The next morning, I walked into that meeting with a complete PRD in hand. To everyone else, it looked like I had been planning it for weeks.

## How GenAI Helped on My Crypto Gateway Project  

When I was designing a B2B crypto payment gateway for merchants, genAI didn't solve compliance nightmares or write code. But it gave me leverage.  

I used it to spin up quick HTML wireframes that I could throw in front of designers and engineers. Were they pretty? No. But they gave us something tangible to react to on day one instead of debating abstract requirements. For complex transaction flows, I asked it to generate UML diagrams. That cut hours out of my prep time and, more importantly, helped the team spot edge cases we might have missed if I'd been sketching boxes by hand.  

I also leaned on AI for competitor analysis. Instead of slogging through dozens of payment providers, I could pull side-by-side breakdowns of features, fees, and onboarding friction, then validate the key details myself. It wasn't flawless, but it got me 80 percent of the way there in a fraction of the time.  

All of that meant I could spend my real energy on the things AI couldn't touch: convincing merchants crypto payments were worth the hassle, building compliance flows that wouldn't scare regulators, and experimenting with pricing models in markets where "normal" is a moving target.

## Bottom Line  

Generative AI isn't here to replace PMs. It's here to cut through sludge work and give us more time for the calls that matter. The teams that treat AI like a system with evaluation, economics, and guardrails win. The ones that treat it like a magic trick? They get exposed the minute people see the wires.
