          <p>Hey, I'm Drake — part product lead, part hands-on builder, and always exploring. From remote teams to blockchain startups, I've spent the last decade learning how great software gets made (and how to avoid burning out more than just servers).</p>

<p>My curiosity didn't stop at product roadmaps — it pulled me into code, teams, and everything in between. I've built prototypes, shipped experiments, and helped scale ideas from startup scrappiness to strategic execution. Now, stepping into senior leadership, I bring both a ground-level understanding and a high-level perspective to the work I do.</p>

<p>I started my career in AAA gaming at Electronic Arts, where I got a front-row seat to how great teams build massive, immersive digital products. That background taught me the value of storytelling, systems, and iteration — lessons I carried into ecommerce and fintech. Payment integrations eventually introduced me to crypto, and from there, I dove headfirst into blockchain product development. Today, I bring that same spirit of exploration and structure to every product I touch.</p>

<p>When I'm not building products or tinkering with code, you'll probably find me in a cozy kitchen experimenting with recipes I've picked up while traveling the world, gaming late into the night, or exploring a new city with a laptop in my backpack. Whether it's food, travel, or side hustles, I'm always chasing that mix of creativity, challenge, and a bit of fun.</p>

<h2 id="the-brains-behind-the-build">The Brains Behind the Build</h2>

<p>Building this blog is my way of bringing together everything I'm passionate about — from product management and coding to the journeys that come with working remotely around the world. It's a space where I share lessons learned, practical insights, and sometimes a few recipes or travel stories along the way. I want this to be a resource for anyone navigating the intersection of technology, creativity, and curiosity. The tech world can feel complex, but through this blog, I aim to make it approachable, interesting, and inspiring for everyone.</p>

<p>Looking back, each step in my journey—from launching my first game project at Electronic Arts (NCAA Basketball 10) to diving into ecommerce payments and exploring blockchain—has shaped how I approach product and tech today.</p>

<p>As someone who bridges product and code, I'm always exploring new skills and perspectives. The thrill of discovery is constant — there's always another layer to understand, another problem to crack.</p>

<p>Whether you're here for the tech, the product talk, or just curious what a digital nomad does between commits and coffee — thanks for dropping in. DrakeWorks is my way of documenting the journey, sharing what I've learned, and hopefully helping a few folks along the way. And if you're building something ambitious in the product or fintech space, <a href="/contact">I'm always open to talking shop</a>.</p>
